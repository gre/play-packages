h1. The context

Linux users enjoy package management and repositories.
We are lazy of browsing all the internet just to find one binary installation...

Unfortunately, there are no ready package for Play Framework.

I've so begun to make some of them, specially for ArchLinux.
If anyone want to share other distribution's packages, feel free to contribute.


h1. What distribution supported ?

 * (soon) ArchLinux : *yaourt -S playframework*
