h1. The context

Linux users enjoy packages management by repositories.
We are lazy of browsing all the internet just to find one binary installation...

Unfortunately, there are no ready package for Play Framework.
I've so begun to make some of them, specially for ArchLinux. If anyone want to share other distribution's packages, feel free to contribute.

The best solution is a way to download the play framework zip during the installation. It's pretty simple with ArchLinux but I don't know if it's possible with all Linux distributions.

h1. What distribution supported ?

 * (soon) ArchLinux : *yaourt -S playframework*
